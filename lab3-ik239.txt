a brief discussion of the major difficulties encountered:
=======
3/8	  18:00  3:00  3	Fixed it. pmap_copy was sharing page tables but
						not copying them on write, and some flags were
						set wrong so write on copy never happened for the child.
3/8   21:00  1:30  4    Fixed permissions that were causing 4th tests to fail and now
						working on last part of 4.
3/8   22:30  1:00  4    Fixed another stupid bug. (reversed source and destination
						in SYS_COPY in get. All tests pass except merge.
3/9   19:00  2:00  5    Found a stupid bug that made >1 SYS_COPY or SNAP in
						row to cause a protection fault. Close to 100%!
3/9   21:00  3:00  5    Went over a lot of the merging code. Had a bug with flag-checking
						in syscall.c where SYS_COPY would also be done whenever 
						SYS_MERGE was requested. This lead to weird results in merging
						but now it's fixed.
