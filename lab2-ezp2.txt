2/03   1:00   2:00  1   Implemented spinlocks and added mutex to kern/mem.c.
2/07  17:00   6:00  NA  Worked through the rest of the parts, FIRST CUT!
2/12  18:00   6:00  3   Attempted to do syscall... the spec was kind of unclear
                          on what exactly to do.
2/13  18:00   2:00  3   Made a few changes, pushed to team repo.
2/14  12:00   4:00  3   Looks like Ivan was able to make Part 3 work!
2/14  22:00   2:00  4   Trap reflection has a heisenbug... so we couldn't figure
                          out exactly what the problem was...
2/16  16:00   2:00  4   Read over the code a little more, still can't figure it
                          out...

             24:00  TOTAL time spent

Major difficulties:  There was an enormous amount of code to work through, and
especially for part 3, the spec wasn't exactly clear on what we were supposed to
do, until we emailed the TA and he clarified it for us.  Also, debugging is
extremely difficult.  The reason we were unable to get trap reflection to work
was that there was a problem with our lab 1 submission.  Fortunately, Ivan was
able to figure that out!
