CS422 final project
Eric Ho and Eric Pan


In this project, we made improvements to the PIOS shell, adding such functionalities as left/right arrow key navigation in the command line, viewing command line history with the up/down arrow keys, using tabs for command line autocompletion, crtl commands to navigate the command line (ctrl-a,ctrl-e,ctrl-d,ctrl-h,ctrl-p,ctrl-n), and changing text color (type in blue,magenta,orange,etc.). Type 'make qemu' to test it out!
