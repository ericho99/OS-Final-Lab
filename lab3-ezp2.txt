----  -----  ----- ---- ---------
2/27  20:00   4:00  1   Read the specification, did the reading mentioned in
                          exercise 1.
2/28   6:00   4:00  1   I think I did exercise 2, not sure if it's correct...
2/28  12:00   6:00  1   YES!  Finished the first part (or at least I can pass)
                          the test case now :)
2/28  20:00   4:00  2+  Started working on part 2, looked more at the later
                          parts, and they seem easier... I also really hope
                          that my code for part 1 is right!  I guess this is
                          what I have for first cut :/
3/05  20:00   2:00  2   Continued working on part 2, no real progress, but I
                          think Eric Ho's got this.
3/06  12:00  10:00  3   Completed part 3 YESSSSSSSSSS!  It passes the test case
                          for protection if we comment out the test for fork.
3/07   8:00   8:00  4   Finished part 4, doesn't pass any test cases, though,
                          so it's either buggy or depends on part 5 to pass the
                          test cases... I think it's really annoying when you
                          have to complete a later part to test a previous one.
3/07   6:00   6:00  5   Wrote the code for 5, can't test since something is
                          definitely buggy... Already skipped something to work
                          on this today, but I have to go now, hopefully my team
                          can finish this!

             44:00  TOTAL time spent

Major difficulties:  
We had three weeks to do this because it was extremely hard and long.  I still
don't think it was enough time, considering that many of us in the group had
midterms and stuff, or had to leave on Friday, which was when this lab was due.
I spent a while coding, but a lot of time was also spent debugging.  It's hard
to tell if the program doesn't work because of bugs from the current part, a
previous part, or something from previous labs.
