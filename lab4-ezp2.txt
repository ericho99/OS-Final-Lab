3/28   8:00   4:00  1   Read the specification, fixed some things from lab 3
3/28   6:00   3:00  1   Successfully pass the root case, 1/11 test cases
                          woo-hoo, but seems like a long lab
3/28   9:00   1:00  1   Implemented read/write, but for some reason, I can't
                          pass the first case anymore, even when I undo all
                          changes... this is weird, I'll email the TA
3/28  10:00   1:00  1   I decided to disable the spinlock_release panic for now,
                          and I managed to pass the second test case after
                          some debugging, turns out I forgot to set the fi->size
                          after writing from the buffer
4/03  12:00   4:00  234 Read through the rest of the lab
4/03  22:00   2:00  NA  Completed the lab, debugged a few small things that was
                          causing it to fail some of the time

Major difficulties:  This was probably the lab that was the least amount of work
so far, and there weren't any major difficulties.  It was really annoying with
the first merge, because there were two proc_init() calls in init() so it was
causing spinlock errors, but luckily we were able to catch that.  Debugging at
the end was a bit annoying because we would get 100/100 some of the time, but
not always--turns out to be a small thing in pmap_pagefault().
